[**Background**

Ever played [Mad Libs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs)?  If you haven't, here's the basic's of it.

> "Mad Libs consist of a book that has a short story on each page with many key words replaced with blanks. Beneath each blank is specified a lexical or other category, such as "noun", "verb", "place", or "part of the body".[10] One player asks the other players, in turn, to contribute some word for the specified type for each blank, but without revealing the context for that word. Finally, the completed story is read aloud. The result is usually comic, surreal and somewhat nonsensical."

**Goal**

Create a Mad Libs style game, where the program asks the user for certain types of words, and then prints out a story with the words that the user inputted. The story doesn't have to be too long, but it should have some sort of story line.

Tip - It's easiest to write out a quick story on a piece of paper or a word document, and then go back through and see which words the user should be able to change.

**Subgoals**

* If the user has to put in a name, change the first letter to a capital letter.

* Change the word "a" to "an" when the next word in the sentence begins with a vowel.
](You remember those multiplication tables from elementary school, right? [The ones where you choose a number on the top row and one on the side and see where they meet on the chart](http://imgur.com/7Mt63OD)? Good. It would be easy enough to just write it out, but let's try using Python to our advantage.

**Goal**

Create a program that prints out a multiplication table for the numbers 1 through 9. It should include the numbers 1 through 9 on the top and left axises, and it should be relatively easy to find the product of two numbers. Do **not** simply write out every line manually (ie print('7 14 21 28 35 49 56 63') ).

**Subgoals**

* As your products get larger, your columns will start to get crooked from the number of characters on each line. Clean up your table by evenly spacing columns so it is very easy to find the product of two numbers.

* Allow the user to choose a number to change the size of the table (so if they type in 12, the table printed out should be a 12x12 multiplication table).)
